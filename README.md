# flutter_community_challenges

A Flutter application to manage community driven Flutter development challenges

## How it works
- Users can submit app ideas as Challenge Suggestions. Other users may vote on them
- Every other Sunday, the Challenge Suggestion with the highest vote count will move into the
Upcoming Challenges queue
- Every other Sunday (in sync with the previously mentioned timing), the Upcoming Challenge at
the front of the queue will become the Current Challenge
- Users will develop their apps to submit as entries to the current challenge during a 12 day
period. After the development period closes, the voting period will start. Voting will only be
open for 48 hours. At the end of the voting period, the entry with the highest vote count will be
moved into the Hall Of Fame as the winner, and the next Upcoming Challenge will be moved from the
queue to become the Current Challenge
